excerpt: "We propose a 2 step rate optimal estimator for the non-oriented dyadiclinear regression model interacted  individual effects. The estimator remains consistent when the individual effects are additive rather than interactive.  We  observe that the individual effects  alter the eigenvalue distribution of the data's matrix representation in significant and distinctive ways.  We  offer a correction for the <i>ordinary least squares</i>' objective function to attenuate the statistical noise that arises due to the individual effects, and in some cases, completely eliminate it. The new objective function is similar to the <i>least squares</i> estimator's objective function from the large N large T literature (Bai (2009)). In general, the objective function is ill behaved and admits multiple local minima. Following a novel proof strategy, we show that in the presence of interactive effects, an iterative process in line with Bai (2009)'s converges to a  global minimizer and is asymptotically normal when initiated properly.  The new proof strategy suggests a computationally  more advantageous and asymptotically equivalent estimator. While the iterative process does not converge when the individual effects are additive, we show that the alternative estimator remains consistent for all slope parameters.
