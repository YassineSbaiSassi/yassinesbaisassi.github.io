1. “Randomized Controlled Trials for models with dyadic outcomes” (with Bryan Graham and Michael Jansson)
2. "The k-composite likelihood estimator"\
**Abstract:** <em>Extends the idea of the composite likelihood estimator on dyadic random graph models. The estimator proposed is obtained by maximizing the average likelihoods of all $k-$ node subgraphs of the entire $N- $ node graph. The properties of this estimator are studied for different regimes of $k$.</em>
