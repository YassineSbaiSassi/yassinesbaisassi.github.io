I am joining the Economics Department at New York University as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2024. I completed my PhD in Economics at the University of California, Berkeley in May 2024. My research primarily focuses on the estimation and inference of network models. Additionally, I am interested in panel data models and matching theory.
